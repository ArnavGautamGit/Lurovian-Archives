# Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks
The Event that changed all of the history of Lurov and cemented the [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] as a superpower that couldn't be challenged by any other.

Friends since childhood, the heir apparent of [[Kingdoms/Owlesian Empire\|Owlesian Empire]], [[John VI Forechester\|John VI Forechester]] was great friends with the then-Captain of his Royal Guard [[People/Edward Nightingale\|Edward Nightingale]].

When John married [[Ivara I Bronze\|Ivara I Bronze]], he visited Owlett and met Edward to make sure his friend made a match with a Drakona as well and does not feel left out that he is not treated well just because he is not a noble, but the son of a General. John brought many pictures suffixed with Familial History, Edward revealed that he was taken but promised to "increase co-operation with the Drakona" in his next generation. Later Edward's firstborn child, [[People/Sir Arthur I Nightingale\|Arthur]] and [[Nysa I White\|Nysa I White]] chose each other.

Arthur's sister married into [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] and made it a three way alliance and avoid the Raebershires feeling they were being singled out. That still did not help [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] avoid feeling alienated because they felt neglected anyway. It was simply a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. There were not enough cities to rule for the sheer number of Houses that wished to rule them.

Raebershires sought more land even if they had to rebel & [[Events/The Raebershire Rebellion\|The Raebershire Rebellion]] made things unstable once more.
