# The Raebershire Rebellion
The [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] felt very neglected with the politics of the Day. They were a cousin house to the ruling [[House Forechester\|House Forechester]] but they were not given any much importance during and after the [[Events/Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks\|Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks]].

Many Raebershires say that it was the case earlier as well - they were sidelined and given the furthest-most region to the Capital but it was not that big of a deal since they had the largest city in [[Kingdoms/Owlesian Empire\|Owlesian Empire]] after the Capital Itself since both land & sea shipments have to go through [[Quakeport\|Quakeport]] to reach anywhere... They claim it somehow got worse After Unification that the terms of Unification did not suit them.

Not to mention the [[Appearance of the Sea Serpent\|Appearance of the Sea Serpent]] made tradeships avoid the Dragon Sea altogether - hurting their purse. Merging with the Dragons meant that since the trade is now internal to the State, House Raebershire would not be able to collect taxes and fares over goods entering and exiting the estate.

In one year, they planned a Rebellion, they staged an attack on Queen [[Ivara I Bronze\|Ivara I]] with the Drakona of [[House Blue\|House Blue]] who felt similarly neglected.

Right after her coronation ceremony ended, two archers from the guard who were from House Blue shot the Queen in the shoulder and Knights of House Raebershire showed up to the Hall in full plate armour and demanded that she get down the throne and rip the agreement of merger. Before the Queen could say anything, there was an outright sword fight ensuing between the loyalists and the separatists.

Two of the Seperatists made it up the steps, they were barely 5 strides away from the Queen when [[People/Sir Arthur I Nightingale\|Arthur Nightingale]] intervened and subdued the attackers by chopping their sword arms and kicking them down the steps. It was not long until the Warriors (including Arthur) were able to derive a safe exit to get the Queen out of danger.

Unfortunately, the separatists had thought of this. The discolouration of scales around the arrow wound and arrowhead shape chosen to maximise penetration all seemingly glaring at us & shouting from the rooftops that the arrow was poisoned.

While infected by the slow poison, she in her final moments Knighted Arthur Nightingale whereas the new ruler, King [[John VI Forechester\|John VI Forechester]] granted the young Arther the [[Kingdoms/Owlesian Empire\|Lordship of Owlesia]] including those lands which were formerly controlled by the Raebershires.

Raebershire Nobles were already on the other side of the Dragonpeaks and took refuge with another local lord who they also betrayed to gain control over [[Wishborne\|Wishborne]] and surrounding regions. Eventually allying with [[House Darpley\|House Darpley]] and trying to Steal the Elven Crown
