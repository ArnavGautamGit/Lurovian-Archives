# Kingdom of Dragonpeaks
A Kingdom surrounding the Dragonpeaks Mountain Ranges on the east and the south.
The Current Kingdom is formed after the [[Events/Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks\|Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks]] and the first ruler of the unified kingdom was Queen [[Ivara I Bronze\|Ivara I Bronze]] who made the date of the unification document being signed as a new official calendar of the state which is still used. (please see the  [[Lurovian Calendars#Unification Calendar\|Unification Calendar]] for more)

### Map and Surroundings
On the map blow, the area in RED is the current Kingdom of Dragonpeaks.
![Kingdom of Dragonpeaks.png](/img/user/Images/Kingdom%20of%20Dragonpeaks.png)


The area in GREEN are the [[Magical Woods\|Magical Woods]] which is very closely allied to the Kindom.
Another one of their allies, the [[Princely State of Vulcanroth\|Princely State of Vulcanroth]] is perpetually at war with [[Forever Dark\|Forever Dark]] and have refugee bases and Island territories illustrated in ORANGE right betweenHistorically Owlesian Territory and the town of [[Ribbetton\|Ribbetton]] Magical Woods to gain protection from both Dragonpeaks and the Woods. They receive trade & supplies from Ribbetton and [[Seashire\|Seashire]].

The Orc tribes which crossed the Sunrise Ocean to invade the east have their territories illustrated in CYAN blue whereas the Raebershire and Elven Territories are in Violet and Gold respectively.

### Crime and Punishment
Being Exiled in the [[Exile Forest\|Exile Forest]] is a punishment for many heinous crimes like Adultery but being recruited as a Dark Sailor is worse. The punishment for societal crimes (like Murder, Purjury, Prejudice or Prejudicial Violence, Racism, Inciting or Commiting Arson, Genocide etc.) in Dragonpeaks is often punished by a being sailed to certain bases in the Forever Dark operated by the Kingdom & being left there as an official recruit to help [[Princely State of Vulcanroth\|Princely State of Vulcanroth]] fight the Forever Dark - and in case the Orcs (who also have their bases) feel hungry and run out of supplies, then fighting them to not become an Orken Delicacy on their Dinner Tables. Since this form of punishment has its roots in the Orken Tribes which the surrounding kingdoms have adopted, the Orcs in these Islands are also criminals of the most heinously evil nature - criminals that have committed all sorts of crime from Rape, Murder, Incitement of Genocide among other.

### Ancestries
Demography of the Kingdom is dominated by [[Human\|Human]] and the [[Drakona\|Drakona]] Ancestries.

Although there is a number of [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Elf (DH)\|Elves]] who live in Serpentia and the surrounding [[Exile Forest\|Exile Forest]]. These minorities moved in from the lands West of the Dragonpeaks (areas currently under Raebershire Control) many generations before the events of [[Archived Tales/Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]] in search of work. The Elves were always seen as different since they migrated from the other side of Dragonpeaks and they themselves did not want to mingle much in cities so devoid of forests so they settled in the Trade-Heavy [[City of Eslance\|City of Eslance]] (due to its Port Access) and created new settlements in and near the Exile Forest due to the Trees being of similar species belonging to the same genus. The Elves were the first ones to spot the Sea Serpent and hence the name of their City became Serpentia!

Territories which are on the East of Dragonpeaks from [[Quakeport\|Quakeport]] to [[Owlett\|Owlett]] were historically a part of the [[Kingdoms/Owlesian Empire\|Owlesian Empire]] and see Humans, [[Giant\|Giants]] and [[Dwarf\|Dwarves]] dominate the rural landscape with little to no other Ancestries unless we go to the [[Royal Wizarding School of Owlett\|Royal Wizarding School of Owlett]] or some other Urban Settlement where [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Simiah (DH)\|Simiah]], [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Galapa (DH)\|Galapa]] and [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Ribbet (DH)\|Ribbets]] also live on Student Visa or as Professors.

### Communities
People may find all communities here, especially in the massive cities with busy ports like the cities of Quakeport and Eslance as they act as melting points of various cultures!

In regions surrounded by forests like Serpentia, there is majority of Wildborne communities with some minority of Wanderbornes.

One may find Orderborne, Loreborne and a minority of Ridgeborne in moderately big towns like Triton whereas in a city with a river-port like Seashire one may spot Seaborne, Loreborne and Orderborne communities dominate the others. 

Ofcourse in historic capitals like Dragonpeak Citadel and Owlett, one would find more Highborne and Loreborne that any other location! Whereas in Military Strongholds close to the Mountains like [[Locations/Castle Whitebreak\|Castle Whitebreak]] and [[Triton\|Triton]]- one might find many Ridgeborne and Orderborne.

Overall these regions are mixes of various Communities where one may see (for example) Wildborne dominate in areas near or inside forests and Seaborne dominate islands and ports!
