Being Exiled in the Exile Forest is a punishment for many heinous crimes like Adultery but being recruited as a Dark Sailor is worse. The punishment for societal crimes (like Purjory, Prejudice, Racism, Inciting or Commiting Arson etc.) in Dragonpeaks is often punished by a being sailed to certain bases in the Forever Dark operated by the Kingdom & being left there as an official recruit to help [[Princely State of Vulcanroth\|Princely State of Vulcanroth]] fight the Forever Dark - and in case the Orcs (who also have their bases) feel hungry, then fighting them to not become an Orken Delicacy.
