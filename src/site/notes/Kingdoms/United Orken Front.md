# United Orken Front
> A Union run by Orcs of many Orken and Goblin Kingdoms of the [[Great Orc Desert\|Great Orc Desert]] and now has spread to the other side in the [[Eastern Desert\|Eastern Desert]]

Their Capital is not singular or fixed, since they (at their core) are a collection of tribes who have their own capitals.

They have a few bases in [[Forever Dark\|Forever Dark]], which they use to send their criminals if they are to be exiled instead of becoming dinner or if the criminal cannot be eaten because of the criminal also being Orc or Goblin.

They have captured the Deserted Lands in the [[Eastern Desert\|Eastern Desert]] and set up their cities. The tribe ruling there rules from [[Zlanta\|Zlanta]] after declaring themselves an independent tribe and attacking the Eastern Deserts.
