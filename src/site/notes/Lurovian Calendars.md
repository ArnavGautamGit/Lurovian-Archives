# Lurovian Calendars
There are various calendars used by different cultures across Lurov.
Since I, Garnav Autumn live in the [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]], I will use the calendars popular there.
Common rule for all calendars is that the zero year is written using the "before" syntax as in the year of [[Events/The Raebershire Rebellion\|The Raebershire Rebellion]] will be 0 YBR but the year after it would be 1 YAR.

### Rebellion Calendar
Used solely in this Archive for marking time relative to [[Events/The Raebershire Rebellion\|The Raebershire Rebellion]] that changed the political landscape of Lurov. Keeping the rebellion as the 0 year, YBR stands for "Years Before Rebellion" and "YAR stands for Years after Rebellion".

it must be noted that the Contemporary Calendar of the time which is often still used in Dragonpeaks is the Unification Calendar. Both of them are used interchangably.

This Calendar was also used by the Raebershires to act superior. Although it failed.

### Unification Calendar
Actually Official Calendar used in the Dragonpeaks and keeps the event of [[Events/Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks\|Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks]] as the 0 year.
$$\large 0 \ BU = 1 \ YBR$$
If a person is born in the same year as the unification year but born before the EXACT date of the Unification, they use BU in their Birthdate on Official Certificates where there is not enough reason, space or provision to write the exact Birthdate (often due to Privacy reasons). Same rules are used for events.

### Scar Lake Calendar
The Scar Lake Calendar is the Calendar based on taking the mythological date of a meteriotire crashing into the [[Locations/Faunland Forest\|Locations/Faunland Forest]] and made a massive gorge which is seen as the source of all magic, Elves, Faun, Firbolgs and all other non-human species.

Naturally this calendar was used and popularised by the Elves. This was the official calendar for both the Independent Kingdoms before the [[Events/Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks\|Owlesian Empire's merger into the Dragonpeaks]] which gave rise to the Unification Calendar.

The time before the meteorite crashing is called BTC or "Before The Crash" and the time after meteorite crashing is called "ATC" or "After The Crash". The Lake which covers the scar did not take its current shape until 10 ATC.
$$\large 0 \ BU = 1 \ YBR = 1985 \ ATC$$

It is now used as the Standard Calendar after the formation of the [[Lurovian Union\|Lurovian Union]].
Historically it is the oldest calendar in Lurov and people of all heritage have used it at some point of time except Orcs who do not care about calendars and just count the number of years it has been from a particular incident. Orkish writings often showcase phrases like "when XYZ happened ABC years ago".
