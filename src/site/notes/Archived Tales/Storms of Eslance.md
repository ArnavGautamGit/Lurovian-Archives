# Storms of Eslance
> A Story of a group of Adventurers that very soon shaped the political landscape of the entirety of Lurov. The Story begins with [[People/Nidus I Bronze\|Lord Nidus, the first]] selecting a few adventurers from the recommendations provided to investigate a shipwreck.

The Central Pieces to the story change depending on the Timeline which itself changes depending upon which adventurers were hired by Lord Nidus.

### Various Timelines

[[Fourth Wall Break/SoE Timeline 1A\|SoE Timeline 1A]] (with JIIT friends)
[[SoE Timeline 1B\|SoE Timeline 1B]] 

### Story Opening
The tensions between [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] and the [[Kingdoms/United Orken Front\|United Orken Front]] have been on the rise. The entire region would have been a massive warzone if Lord Nidus had not sent a diplomat ship. 
That very ship that set its sail from the Trade City of Eslance now lays crashed into the islands of Bridgeport. 
Lord Nidus has hired the party to investigate the wreckage & figure out how it may have happened. Time is limited before this falls victim to exaggerated stories and public theories about what may have happened.

> "The Primary Reason for hiring all of you is because you are unmarked - unaffiliated to any kingdom. Everything will look routine & any informers of the Orcs would not be alarmed, if there are any there at all."
> ~ [[People/Nidus I Bronze\|Nidus I Bronze]], Lord of [[Locations/Castle Whitebreak\|Castle Whitebreak]]
