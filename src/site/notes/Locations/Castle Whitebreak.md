# Castle Whitebreak
> Its is a Castle ruled by [[House Bronze\|House Bronze]] in the [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] which is considered the closest castle near the Peaks without actually reaching them. The foothills are visible at some distance. 

The Castle is built on the region where the primary river forks to the west and east respectively. Both these distributaries of the Great River are called "Westflowing River" and "Eastflowing River" respectively.

### Castle's Lord and Significance 
Lord [[People/Nidus I Bronze\|Nidus I Bronze]] is the current ruler of Castle Whitebreak. Hereby controlling the East-West trade channels from one side to another across the mountain range.
Any ration going to the forges and stations in the mountain range is shipped from strategic castles such as [[Locations/Castle Whitebreak\|Castle Whitebreak]], [[Triton\|Triton]] and [[Owlett\|Owlett]].

### Paintings of the Castle
The Painting below depicts the size and scale of Castle Whitebreak. it shows external garrisson quarters & training grounds on the right - used mainly to house & train cadets and active military personnel. Five companies of a 100 soldiers stays on reserve (selected on rotation basis). The reserve company stays indoors with the Lord. No cadets are allowed to cross the entrance gate to the castle, any cadet is either transferred before they see the inside of the castle or absorbed (permanently stationed after being given the job)

On the left face of the hill where the Castle is located, we see multiple Gatehouses and towers lining the climb up the tower.

This painting was done from the second bridge on the Westflowing River open to all personnel be it civillians or military. The Eastflowing river forks off from behind these jutting spires.

The Painting below depicts the entrance bridge seen in the first painting but more clearly, notice how the bridge is staggered with respect to the entrance, to foil any attempts to use a battering ram to force the gate open. Even if they do, The gatehouse roof is littered with murder holes & internal arrowloops faintly visible in the paintings.

Their have been many attempts to break down the construction & recreate the success of such an inpenetrable castle but [[House Bronze\|House Bronze]] is secretive in nature regarding what information goes out in the open.

### Surrounding Town
The Castle was built first to safeguard the [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] against a two-front war against the [[Kingdoms/Owlesian Empire\|Owlesian Empire]] and territories to the west controlled by [[House Darpley\|House Darpley]] & other families. It served as an important military and espionage base of operations protecting both the mountain range & kingdom while providing a safe house to the handlers of external spies who monitored both regions.

The town and the castle share the same name. The town of whitebreak also contains the term 'Castle' in it. The town was named such due to it being proximity to the Castle of such great importance. First people who moved in & began a settlement were the other family members of the military & espionage operatives - their mothers, wives, children etc. Then came schools for their children which were run by locals of near-by villages and certain volunteers among the new families.
