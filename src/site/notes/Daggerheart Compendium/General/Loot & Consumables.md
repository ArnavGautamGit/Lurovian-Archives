# Loot & Consumables
There are 4 main types of Items: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary.
Legendary items might be the only item of their kind, a reward for an incredibly difficult or dangerous job, or a powerful adversary’s most precious and guarded treasure.

Refer to Page 128 to 132 of the Core Rulebook for details.
