# Human (DH)
> Humans are... well humans! They are a common feature in every RPG and [[Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] is no different where Humans are included as an included [[Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|Ancestry]].

A full-grown human's maximum height ranges from 5 to 6 feet - however humans may be shorter or taller. Humans (along with the [[Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Drakona (DH)\|Drakona (DH)]]) dominate the [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] in terms of population and power while ranking high in demographics and social status in many regions and such as the spheres of [[Kingdoms/The Elven Confederacy\|Kingdoms/The Elven Confederacy]] 

On taking the Human Ancestry, you gain the following Ancestry Features:
- ***High Stamina***: Take an extra [[Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] at character creation.
- ***Adaptability***: When you fail a roll that used one of your experiences, you can mark 1x [[Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to reroll (must take new roll).

In-game mechanics make it so that Humans live approximately 100 years on average.
