# Lurov
The world of Lurov, it housed and continues to house many Empires.
From Zlanta and the Magical Woods in the extreme East all the way to Merman's Forest in the extreme West. A compressed map of the lands is presented below.

One would have needed access to the Secret Chambers of some shady agents to see the entire map in its True Glory back in the day especially since maps of such nature were based on inputs & whispers received after intense Espionage, they were the key to overcoming some natural or artificially-made barriers defenders must have placed. Since it is the times of the [[Lurovian Union\|Lurovian Union]] nowadays, the map is open to the public. The Map you see above is based before the [[Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]] had even began brewing properly!

For viewing the map in its full glory, please visit the [Upper Echelons of the Eslance Library](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn0EzgXdCEwiB8kuy_5bcLa4MbKU7zFB/view?usp=sharing)
