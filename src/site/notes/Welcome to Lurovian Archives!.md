# Welcome to the Lurovian Archives!
I am the Archivist of this Archive, Garnav Autumn.
This is an archive of all the happenings in the lands of [[Lurov\|Lurov]].

Among the many chronicles inscribed within the pages of this Archive, few are as defining as the Second Book of this archive: [[Archived Tales/Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]]. A saga of shifting allegiances, whispered prophecies, exploration and a fine balance of individual security in the garb of collective security.
