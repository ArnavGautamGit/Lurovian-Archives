# Welcome to Lurovian Archives!
I am the Archivist of this Archive, Garnav Autumn.
This is an archive of all the happenings in the lands of [[Lurov\|Lurov]].

Among the many chronicles inscribed within the pages of this Archive, few are as defining as the Second Book of this archive: [[Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]]. A saga of shifting allegiances, whispered prophecies, exploration and a fine balance of individual security in the garb of collective security.

But before we go as far, I should give you a background of what has led to a saga so great that it seems like the Gods themselves have turned playwrights and carved it scene by scene....

The mountains of the Dragonpeaks were always sought after... all the Kingdoms and Empires in and around the continent of Martlock wanted their flags & banners to adore those mountains.
The peaks themselves were not special, but they held ores of the Dragonsteel inside, a metal so powerful that a sword born from it can even kill the Gods let alone anything else. Its ore could only be melted by the heat of a Dragon's Breadth. The [[Dwarves\|Dwarves]] of [[Owlett\|Owlett]] keep the rest of the entire process in wraps so that their swords cannot be recreated and they hold a monopoly in the market. 

Many Kingdoms came & perished but none could defeat the guardians of those coveted peaks - The [[Drakona\|Drakona]] and their Dragons.

These peaks are the only location in the entirety of Lurov which has Dragons. Millenia came and Millenia passed but the Dragons stayed loyal to the [[Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] which was ruled by the Drakona for Centuries until one day, when the son of the King of the [[Owlesian Empire\|Owlesian Empire]], Prince [[John VI Forechester\|John VI Forechester]] from [[Owlett\|Owlett]] married with Princess [[Ivara I Bronze\|Ivara I Bronze]]. It was agreed upon that the ruler would still remain a person from Bronze family.

Queen Ivara passed during an attempt of treason to snatch the throne at 76, making John VI the first human to ascend the Dragon Throne and rule the kingdom from the [[Dragonpeak Citadel\|Dragonpeak Citadel]]. 
The reign was shot-lived since John himself became ill and grim since Ivara passed and succumbed to his isolation when he joined his wife in heaven after he peacefully passed in his sleep just a week post-coronation...

I am yet to hear and read about a purer image of Love than that couple even after my years of archiving the Lurovian Happenings! The perpetrator of treason was a family member of the Blue Drakona Family. She was caught and killed for Treason.

Many of the Drakona families considered the Forechester children - however human - to be Dragons just like them since they have the same Draconic Bloodline. Forechester Family regularly married in Drakona Families, rarely ever having Human mingling.

The Cousin House of Forechesters, [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] were not happy to the Drakona-bias in control over the Armies and the Courtroom. Raebershires felt neglected. The Cousin House thought that the only way they can regain their importance like the old Owlesian days is if they gain access to more land under their control. So they proposed a plan to attack and seize land from an Elven-Giant Couniclliary directly West of the Dragonpeaks - opening up to attacking more Elven Settlements.

Everyone agreed at first but then a trade ship returned from [[Vranik\|Vranik]]. It was a Orken Town, a new settlement which was formed after the splitting of the [[Forest Council\|Forest Council]] of the [[Magical Woods\|Magical Woods]]. Dragonpeak wanted to establish peace as the [[United Orken Front\|United Orken Front]] were starting to become the Largest Colonising Force in Lurov.

The Ship returned Disfigured in Orken Paintings and Murals. Smaller Masts were completely broken. The crew had been chopped to pieces and the few left alive to take the ship back to the Dragon City of Eslance had succumbed to their wounds... the shipped was rammed and scratched on either sides of the bow... As if the Orcs made sure the ship does not stray for some time at least.

The Ship crashed into an island in Bridgeport.
The Case was handed to the first cousin of Queen - [[Nidus Bronze\|Nidus Bronze]].
He has sought to investigate with the help of non-Dragonpeak soldiers so that the claim could be avoided that the Dragons were trying to interfere.

This is where the [[Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]] began to brew. Forechesters and most houses withdrew support for the Invasion on one end due to the threat of being invaded from the other.

The incident confirmed one thing though... that whatever is happening in the [[Magical Woods\|Magical Woods]] is a proxy war.
