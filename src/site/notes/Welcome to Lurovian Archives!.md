# Welcome to the Lurovian Archives!
I am the Archivist of this Archive, Arnav Gautam.
This is an archive of all the happenings in the lands of [[Lurov\|Lurov]].

Among the many chronicles inscribed within the pages of this Archive, few are as defining as the first adventure: [[Archived Tales/Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]]. A saga of shifting allegiances, whispered prophecies, exploration and a fine balance of individual security in the garb of collective security.

> For those that are coming from the StartPlaying.games or any other of my online games, I would like to tell you that reading through this is not necessary or needed. It is supposed to be a small little wiki that I made to show my Computer Science Skills. Nothing else. If you are coming from a different campaign or are not the first group to experience this campaign (will be discussed on Session 0) then I would like to warn you about lingering here due to potential spoilers.
