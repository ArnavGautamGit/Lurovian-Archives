# Welcome to the Lurovian Archives!
I am the Archivist of this Archive, Arnav Gautam.
This is an archive of all the happenings in the lands of [[Lurov\|Lurov]].

Among the many chronicles inscribed within the pages of this Archive, few are as defining as the first adventure: [[Archived Tales/Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]]. A saga of shifting allegiances, whispered prophecies, exploration and a fine balance of individual security in the garb of collective security.

> [!info] Reading the entire archive is not necessary!
> For those that are coming from my paid games (online or offline), I would like to tell you that reading through this is not necessary or needed. It is supposed to be a small little wiki that I made primarily to disaminate any Homebrew Rules and only then secondarily give something to read to those 0.001% players who love to read a wiki of a piece of media they are invested in.
