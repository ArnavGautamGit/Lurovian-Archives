# Orc (DH)
> A [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of square-featured humanoids with boar-like tusks protruding from their lower jaws. These tusks are not for eating. They tend to be muscular no matter their size. Often potrayed to be some shade of green, they are likely to be in other shades depending on the local surroundings.

Orcs decorate their tusks just like how [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Inferis (DH)\|Inferis (DH)]] decorate their horns and [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Galapa (DH)\|Galapa (DH)]] decorate their shells. They are very common across TTRPGs and they have been popularised by Tolkien's books and The Lord of The Rings movies. They are between 5 to 7 feet tall.

On taking Orc, you gain the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Sturdy***: Your [[Daggerheart/Mechanics/Armour Score\|Armour Score]] is doubled when only one 1x [[Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] remains.
- ***Tusks***: After making a successful Melee Attack, the Orc can choose to gore their target, adding a 1d6 to the attack.

Average Lifespan of an Orc is 150 years.
