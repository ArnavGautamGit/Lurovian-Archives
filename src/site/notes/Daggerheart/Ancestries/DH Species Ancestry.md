# DH Species Ancestry
In [[Daggerheart/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], there are many different Species/Races that exist. It is interesting to note that there is an assumption that all species/races speak a common language and hence there are no language rules in the game. The Sign Language is also Universal and understood by everyone.

It is upto the GM if they want to hombrew languages for regions or races or if they wish to have the languages be known or everyone uses magic to understand each other regardless of language.

Each Species/Race has a specific set of advantages it provides. They are mentioned in the notes, but please prefer any information on Demiplane over these notes.

The List of Species/Races in [[Daggerheart/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are:
- [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Clank (DH)\|Clank (DH)]] - the automaton or robot like beings in Fantasy

Please note that Mixed Ancestries are possible.
### Mixed Ancestries
Mixed Ancestries are often formed after a union of people with different ancestry and the child being born of such a union will carry a mixed genome.

Sometimes, Mixed Ancestries are formed or needed due to a homebrew backstory or setting.
Either way, there are certain rules the players have to follow for Mixed Ancestries.

The Rules are fairly simple, let's say you have a Goblin & Orc mixed ancestry, you first have to give it some kind of a name.
It is best to ask the [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] if they have it homebrewed. If not, give it a name yourself. It could be "Goblin-Orc" or "Goblin (Orc Lineage)" or you could give it an entirely new name.

Once you have done that, you can now take one feature from each ancestry. You have to take one of the two primary (top) features and then one of the two secondary (bottom) features. 
For Example: In case of [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Goblin (DH)\|Goblin]]-[[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Orc (DH)\|Orc]] you can do the following permutations: either take ***Danger Sense*** (from Goblin) and ***Tusks*** (from Orc) OR take ***Sturdy*** from Orc and ***Surefooted*** from Goblin but you ***CANNOT*** take _Danger Sense_ and _Sturdy_ together.

Also note:
In case of egg-laying species like Drakona forming a union with an Elf, they will need Magic to get an offspring.
