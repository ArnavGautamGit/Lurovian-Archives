# Halfling (DH)
> Although not unique to [[Daggerheart/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], Halflings are a [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] that (as the name suggests) are half-sized [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Human (DH)\|Humans]]. They are the same height as [[Daggerheart/Ancestries/Goblin (DH)\|goblins]] (3-4 feet tall).

Halflings posess incredible hearing and smell (similar to Goblins having great eyesight and hearing). Halflings can even recognise the noise their acquaintances make while walking. Halflings are half the size of a regular Human. They are frequently seen in the mountainous or hilly regions that are not as chilly as Dragonpeaks! For their lower centre of gravity, they are great climbers and trekkers. Most halflings live on the west of the Dragonpeaks in the area currently under control of [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] at the start of [[Archived Tales/Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]] and many live in and around [[Westhold\|Westhold]], [[Mermaid's Forest\|Mermaid's Forest]] and [[Merman's Forest\|Merman's Forest]]. A very small minority is seen in the [[City of Eslance\|City of Eslance]] in [[Kingdoms/Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]].

On taking the Halfling, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Luckbringer***: At the beginning of a session, everyone in the party gets 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] extra.
- ***Internal Compass***: When you roll a 1 on your Hope Dice, you can reroll it.

Halflings Live for approximatley 150 years on average.
